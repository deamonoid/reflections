When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this if I want to share my code with other people and its a good backup option
too, keeping all your files on cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe we dont want to publish that change publically thats why it is preffered to
always pull manually rather than automatically
