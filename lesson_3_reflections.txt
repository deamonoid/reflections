When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this if I want to share my code with other people and its a good backup option
too, keeping all your files on cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe we dont want to publish that change publically thats why it is preffered to
always pull manually rather than automatically


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

Forks is used when we want to clone repository of other member on Github, it will make a copy
on github itself. while clone is used to make a copy from github to local or local to local
whereas branches is used when labelling commit in a single repository.
