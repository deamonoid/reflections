When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this if I want to share my code with other people and its a good backup option
too, keeping all your files on cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe we dont want to publish that change publically thats why it is preffered to
always pull manually rather than automatically


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

Forks is used when we want to clone repository of other member on Github, it will make a copy
on github itself. while clone is used to make a copy from github to local or local to local
whereas branches is used when labelling commit in a single repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Benefit is that if any one changes anything on online repository then git will let us know
that there has been a change in repo by letting us know that things are out of sync. And we
will be able to merge the commit.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

Without github I will collabraate mnaually by meeting people in person or through social
media. It would be difficult as there will be lots of conflict in code merging and there
will be lots of user made mistake. With github people can make changes whenever they want
they dont have to wait for others to resolve conflict with code. Overall its a huge 
advantageous tool.
