It actually pinpointed the exact location where there was a difference and it was very good.
I can easily see differences with "-" and "+" sign as I have seen with github before.

Easy access to old version helps make me a very efficient programmer in long term as when I
will be working on a big project it will help me anaalyse what changes I have made to previos
versions and when and what features I have added. If I am making a consumer product than it is
very benificial in that regard too.

Pros of choosing manually commit are that I can add meaningful commit to the code and can
easily compare between different versions. Cons are that there may be a user error while
commiting he may forget about commiting or he may commit too soon or too late or even may
forget.

Google docs treat each file seperately because in many cases they dont have documents that are
interrelated so thats why they can work by commiting each file seperately. while Git uses
multiple file approach as it uses mainly for code and we all know that in coding big projects
there are high chances that files are inteconnected to each other. So, therefore multiple file
commit makes much more sense.

Git log is used to see different version of files and Git diff to see what changes have been 
made between two different version of file.

Does it make me more confident after using version control? Yes as it was really easy to point
out the bug that has caused the whole program to break by checking out previous commit.

After changing themes and configuring my workspace I will try using git for my Android project.
