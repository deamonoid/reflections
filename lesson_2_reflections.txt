When I initialize a repository it makes a .git file which means I have succesfully created a 
repoditory. We need it to convert our directory to repository and start tracking our files 
in it.

Staging area is the first area where our files will reach before commit. It is different from
working directory and repository as it will start tracking from this area.

Through staging area it is now easy to differentiate between commited code and staged area
code and also difference between working directory and staged area this will minimize the
error and easy our process in committing.
